/**
 * Create a interface 'Graphic' that encapsulates the fallowing method:
 * - draw()
 * <p>
 * Based on this interface implement two classes:
 * - Line: which should print at System out a line
 * <p>
 * ` "------------"`
 * <p>
 * - Square: which should print at System out a square:
 * <p>
 * `    --------
 * |      |
 * |      |
 * --------`
 * <p>
 * - Text: which should print at System out a text
 * <p>
 * Create a Main class where you should initialize an Array of type Graphic with different implementations (Line, Square, Text).
 * Next, with a foreach call the draw() method on each of the array objects.
