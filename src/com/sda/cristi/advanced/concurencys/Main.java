/**
 * - Inherit a class from Thread and override the run( ) method.
 * - Inside run( ), print a message, and then call sleep( ).
 * - Repeat this three times, then return from run( ).
 * - Put a start-up message in the constructor.
 * <p>
 * - Make a separate thread class that calls System.gc( ) and System.runFinalization( ) inside run( ), printing a message as it does so.
 * - Make several thread objects of both types and run them to see what happens.
 * - Experiment with different sleep times to see what happens.
